4. Train team on new patterns

### Code Pattern Differences

#### Button Creation
```mql5
// Standard Controls
CButton button;
button.Create(chart_id, "btn", 0, 10, 10, 100, 40);

// EasyAndFastGUI
CButton button;
CreateButton(button, "Text", window, 0, 10, 10, 90);
```

#### Event Handling
```mql5
// Standard Controls
EVENT_MAP_BEGIN(CMyDialog)
    ON_EVENT(ON_CLICK, m_button, OnClick)
EVENT_MAP_END(CAppDialog)

// EasyAndFastGUI
void OnEvent(const int id, const long& lparam, ...)
{
    if(id == CHARTEVENT_CUSTOM + ON_CLICK_BUTTON)
        HandleButtonClick(lparam);
}
```
